  	<h1>Welcome to the Sons</h1>
  	<h2>Background info</h2>
  	<p>Sons of Anarchy, aka SAMCRO(Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club Redwood Original), is a motorcycle club that operates both illegal and legal businesses in the small town of Charming. They combine gun-running and a garage, plus involvement in other dealings. Clay, the president, likes it old school and violent; while Jax, his stepson and the club's VP, has thoughts about changing the way things are, based on his dead father's journal. Their conflict has effects on both the club and their personal relationships.
